### **Project Title:** Responsive Portfolio Layout

---

### **Project Description**

Create a **responsive portfolio page** using Flexbox. The page should include:
1. A **header** with navigation links.
2. A **hero section** with a title and description.
3. A **skills section** displaying your skills in a card layout.
4. A **projects section** showcasing your projects as cards in a grid.
5. A **contact section** with a form aligned using Flexbox.

---

### **Project Goals**

1. Use **Flexbox properties** to align, distribute, and size elements.
2. Practice both **row** and **column** layouts using `flex-direction`.
3. Apply `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `align-self` for alignment.
4. Use `gap` for spacing between items.

### **Instructions**

#### **1. Set Up Your HTML Structure**
Hereâ€™s an overview of the sections youâ€™ll create:
- **Header**:
  - Logo and navigation links aligned in a row.
- **Hero Section**:
  - Title and description centered vertically and horizontally.
- **Skills Section**:
  - Cards for each skill arranged in rows and wrapped into multiple lines.
- **Projects Section**:
  - Cards arranged in a grid-like structure, responsive to screen size.
- **Contact Section**:
  - A simple form aligned using Flexbox.

#### **2. Use These Flexbox Challenges**
For each section, focus on specific Flexbox properties:

---

### **Header**
**Goal:** Arrange logo and navigation links horizontally.
1. Use `display: flex` and `justify-content: space-between` for alignment.
2. Add `align-items: center` to vertically align the logo and links.

---

### **Hero Section**
**Goal:** Center the title and description both horizontally and vertically.
1. Use `display: flex` on the container.
2. Set `justify-content: center` and `align-items: center`.
3. Try changing the `flex-direction` to see how the layout behaves.

---

### **Skills Section**
**Goal:** Arrange skill cards in rows, and wrap them if the screen is small.
1. Use `display: flex` and `flex-wrap: wrap`.
2. Set `gap` to add spacing between cards.
3. Use `flex-basis` to ensure cards have equal widths (e.g., `flex-basis: 30%`).

---

### **Projects Section**
**Goal:** Create a responsive grid using Flexbox.
1. Use `display: flex` and `flex-wrap: wrap`.
2. Set `flex-basis` and `gap` for consistent card sizes and spacing.
3. Use media queries to adjust the number of cards per row for smaller screens.

---

### **Contact Section**
**Goal:** Align the form elements (labels and inputs) horizontally.
1. Use `display: flex` on the form or individual rows.
2. Apply `gap` to add space between the label and input.
3. Use `align-items: center` to ensure proper vertical alignment.

---

### **Bonus Challenges**

1. **Add Hover Effects**:
   - Add hover styles to navigation links, skill cards, or project cards.

2. **Make It Responsive**:
   - Use media queries to adjust layouts (e.g., stack the navigation links vertically on small screens).

3. **Integrate Pseudo-Classes**:
   - Use `:hover` or `:nth-child()` for unique styling.

---

### **What to Test**
After coding, make sure you:
- Use the browserâ€™s developer tools to inspect your layout and test responsiveness.
- Experiment with different `justify-content` and `align-items` values to understand their effects.
- Ensure the layout adapts well to various screen sizes.

---

### **Final Deliverables**
- A fully functional portfolio layout.
- Responsiveness for both desktop and mobile views.
- A deeper understanding of how Flexbox works.
